** Programming Experience

During my time within Cisco I have been more and more responsible for the programming tasks within my team. This began as simple bash scripts that were running on individual devices for data collection or other tasks requested by customers. Once I was proficient in bash I moved on quickly to programming all these into python as many of our devices are built with a version of python
